TTT_Loadout_Menu
================
Created by Exho on August 15th, 2014 and initially coded in 2 hours. Its my clone of a Coderhire addon that I saw. 

Almost entirely rewritten on 7/12/15 to just work better. Added scrollers for more weapons as well as reducing boilerplate code on the client and improving the serverside code as well.
